# Error
When trying to `git clone` or `git push` I would get the following error

{: .box-error}
git@github.com: Permission denied (public key).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.

To fix this, you need github to trust the machine.
On your machine, run:
```bash 
ssh-keygen
```

Keep it simple by just pressing Enter, Enter, Enter.

```bash
grunt@debian:~/dotfiles$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/grunt/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/grunt/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/grunt/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:w1Hjua5okigioY6v7phkWO3dS0qlC8v9N9xClsr+rDU grunt@debian
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+

```

Keys will be stored in `~/.ssh`
Run `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` and copy the content.

Open github and go to **Account Settings > SSH and GPG keys**
Click **New SSH key**
**Title**: machine name
**Key**: _paste key here_

Now try `git push` or `git clone` and it should work!
